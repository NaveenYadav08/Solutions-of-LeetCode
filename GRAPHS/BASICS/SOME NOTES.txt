Directed and Undirected Weighted Graph: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Undirected Weighted Graph: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Undirected Unweighted Graph: BFS (Breadth-First Search)

 Dijkstra’s Algorithm not applicable on negative weight graphs.  WHY ? 
it do not work on single negative weight cycle graph it is because it is always going to update that as 
always decreasing the distance with negative value.
