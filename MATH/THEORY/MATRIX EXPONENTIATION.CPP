IT IS A WAY TO DO MATRIX MULTIPLICATION QUICKLY ( OF sq matrix )


IT IS MIX OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AND FAST EXPONENTIATION ( binary )
  
it is ALSO USED TO SOLVE LINEAR RECURENCE WHERE F ( N ) DEPENED ON LINEAR POWER OF ITS PREV VALUSE

ITS COMPLEXITY IS   K^3 * LOG n

WE MUST KNOW FIRST K TERMS TO ESTABLISH THE REALTION 

Fn = TRANSFORMATION MATRIX * Fn-1
