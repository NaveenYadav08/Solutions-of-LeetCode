#       Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a sum of distinct non-neighbouring Fibonacci numbers. 

#       n C k =   {n-1} C {k-1}  + {n-1} C {k}

#       if  x repeats and y repeats than total permutation = (x+y)! / (x! * y!)

#       CATALAN number

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.

1 Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
2 Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
2.1  No of binary tree = n! * catalan no
3 Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
4 Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.

The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …
